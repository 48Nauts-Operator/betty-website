# Ema as Blueprint: What NautStar Needs to Match

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Purpose:** Use Ema's $62M playbook as our roadmap

---

## Reality Check

Despite Fortune 500 logos and $62M, Ema's **actual deployed segments** (from demos):

| Segment | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Customer Support / Help Desk | ✅ Active | Their strongest use case |
| Sales & Marketing (AI SDR) | ✅ Active | Lead engagement, CRM automation |
| HR / Employee Experience | ✅ Active | Onboarding, benefits |
| Healthcare | 🟡 Claimed | No demos shown, compliance claims only |
| Legal/Compliance | 🟡 Claimed | Listed but no deep demos |
| Finance | 🟡 Claimed | Listed but no deep demos |

**Insight:** They're still finding product-market fit too. $62M doesn't mean they've cracked regulated industries.
